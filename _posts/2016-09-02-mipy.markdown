I've put a little script on pypi that copies files onto a NodeMCU.

To install it:

    $ pip install --user mipy

Now you can copy files to the device (make sure you have `$HOME/.local/bin` in your
PATH):

    $ mipy cp main.py

My typical workflow is to make a change, then copy it to the board with `-ir`:

    $ mipy -ir cp main.py

This interrupts the running script, copies the file, then resets the device.

Thanks to [mpy-utils](https://github.com/nickzoic/mpy-utils) which I forked to
make mipy.
