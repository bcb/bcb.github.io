I've put a little script on pypi that copies files onto a NodeMCU or other
serial device running Micropython. To install it:

    $ pip install mipy

Now you can copy files to the device:

    $ mipy cp main.py

My typical workflow is to make a change, then copy it to the board with `mipy
-ir`:

    $ mipy -ir cp main.py

This interrupts the running script, copies the file, then does a soft-reset.

You can also set the port, baudrate and other options. See `mipy --help`.

[mpy-utils](https://github.com/nickzoic/mpy-utils) which I forked to make mipy.
