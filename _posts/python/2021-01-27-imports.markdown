An often ignored but important part of the Style Guide for Python Code" (PEP-8)
is the [Imports section](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports).

This part on **grouping imports** is particularly important:

> Imports should be grouped in the following order:
>
> - Standard library imports.
> - Related third party imports.
> - Local application/library specific imports.
>
> You should put a blank line between each group of imports.

## The first group: Standard library imports

These are from the Python's built-in standard library.

```python
from typing import Any
import os
```

## The second group: Related third party imports

These are imports from installed libraries. The PEP says "third-party" which
confuses a lot of people. To me it could be a library maintained by yourself or
the same organisation, but is kept as a separate repository and installed as a
separate package.

```python
from airflow.utils.decorators import apply_defaults
from cx_Oracle import NUMBER
```

## The third group: Local application/library specific imports

I take to mean "imports from the same repository".

```python
from .stored_procedure_operator import StoredProcedureOperator
```

## Putting it together

Separate each group by a blank line.

```
from typing import Any
import os

from airflow.utils.decorators import apply_defaults
from cx_Oracle import NUMBER

from .stored_procedure_operator import StoredProcedureOperator
```

Within each group, sort the lines alphabetically (this is just my preference,
not part of the style guide).
