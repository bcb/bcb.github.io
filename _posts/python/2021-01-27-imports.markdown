An important but often ignored part of he Style Guide for Python Code" (PEP-8)
is the [Imports section](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports).

> Imports should be grouped in the following order:
>
> - Standard library imports.
> - Related third party imports.
> - Local application/library specific imports.
>
> You should put a blank line between each group of imports.

Here's an example of imports:

```
from typing import Any
import os

from airflow.utils.decorators import apply_defaults
from cx_Oracle import NUMBER

from .stored_procedure_operator import StoredProcedureOperator
```

1. The first group is from the Python's standard library.

2. The second group has libraries external to the current repository. The PEP
   says "third-party" which confuses a lot of people. To me it could be a
   library maintained by yourself or the same organisation, but is kept as a
   separate repository and installed as a separate package.

3. The last group I take to mean "imports from the same repository".

Within each group, sort the lines alphabetically.
