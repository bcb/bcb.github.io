Pylint can check for many problems, but my first go-to with linters is always
the `unused-import` rule which ensures nothing is imported that isn't used. If
you want to use more rules, adjust the below commands accordingly.

## Pre-commit hooks

Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com).

Add to the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in the root of your repository:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-pylint
    rev: v2.4.2
    hooks:
      - id: pylint
        args: [--disable=all, --enable=unused-import]
```

Install your git hooks:
```sh
pre-commit install  # or "autoupdate" if you've already installed previously.
```

This will abort a commit if an import isn't used.

## CI/CD

To fail the build if Pylint finds an error, add the following to your build
scripts.

```sh
pylint --disable=all --enable=unused-import /path/to/code
```

Pylint will exit with a non-zero exit status if it finds an error, which should
fail the build.
