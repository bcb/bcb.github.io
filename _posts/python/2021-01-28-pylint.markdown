Pylint can check for many problems, but personally I only use the
`unused-import` rule which ensures nothing is imported that isn't used. If you
want to use more rules, adjust the below commands accordingly.

## Pre-commit hooks

Add to the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in the root of your repository,
_replacing v2.4.2 with the Pylint version you want to use._

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-pylint
    rev: v2.4.2
    hooks:
      - id: pylint
        args: [--disable=all, --enable=unused-import]
```

This will abort a commit if an import isn't used.

## CI/CD

To fail the build if Pylint finds an error, add the following to your build
scripts.

```sh
pylint --disable=all --enable=unused-import /path/to/code/**/*.py
```

Pylint will exit with a non-zero exit status if it finds an error, which should
fail your build.
