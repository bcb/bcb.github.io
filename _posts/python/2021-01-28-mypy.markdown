## Pre-commit hooks

Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com).

Add to the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in the root of your repository:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy
    rev: v0.730
    hooks:
      - id: mypy
        exclude: ^tests/
        args: [--disallow-untyped-calls, --disallow-untyped-defs, --check-untyped-defs]
```

Install your git hooks:
```sh
pre-commit install  # or "autoupdate" if you've already installed previously.
```

## CI/CD

To fail the build if Mypy finds an type error, add the following to your build
script.

```sh
mypy --disallow-untyped-calls --disallow-untyped-defs --check-untyped-defs --ignore-missing-imports /path/to/code
```

Mypy will exit with a non-zero exit status if it finds an error, which should
fail your build.
