Eric Normand talking about how functional programming is actually the more
pragmatic, conservative choice:

> I actually wonder, how much of Clojure's perception is that it is a new
> language, like it's a new way to program, when it's actually a much older way
> to program. And that, if you squint a little it could be the conservative
> choice. It could be the more backwards looking choice. If you're looking for
> what is more rooted in history, what is more rooted in good ideas, it's
> Clojure. Java is more a new kid on the block in that sense.
>
> Clojure is not for the cool kids who just want to be different, it's for the
> old cranky people who are tired of dealing with poorly designed languages
> with fast-moving ecosystems that don't ever solve the problems they talk
> about solving.
